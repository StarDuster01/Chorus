This integration is intended to improve decision-making and design outputs as the dataset grows [1]. The software incorporates design inputs through an interface where engineers can define performance and other requirements, such as topology, inductance, and power [1]. \n\nFurthermore, MPDS must adhere to specific usability and security standards. It is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for those with minimal technical background, and it must protect sensitive design data by complying with regulations such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations (EAR) [5]. Each user must have a unique login to ensure security and compliance. The system aims to maintain a competitive advantage by providing innovative design solutions compared to widely used industry software [5].", "timestamp": "2025-05-15T19:27:24.288329+00:00", "referenced_images": [], "image_details": []}]}
