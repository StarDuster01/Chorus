Here are some key points from the presentation:\n\n1. **Introduction to AI**: The presentation starts by introducing AI and its rapid evolution. It includes foundational training on generative AI and LLMs, comparing these models to sophisticated autocomplete systems [1].\n\n2. **Roles and Personalities**: It features personal anecdotes and roles of key contributors like Matt, who is Co-Founder of Viridity Technologies and Orchard, and Aedhan, a Lead AI Engineer at Viridity Technologies [1].\n\n3. **Use of LLMs**: Emphasizes how AI should be approached as a strategic tool. It should increase revenue or reduce costs, drawing parallels with business technologies like Microsoft Excel [1].\n\n4. **Generative AI**: Discusses the unification of different AI fields into generative models, highlighting significant moments of contact with AI technologies [4].\n\n5. **Practical Applications**: The presentation explores practical uses of AI in business scenarios, including content and campaign automation, AI-enhanced customer service, and strategic problem-solving [2].\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations**: Several slides are dedicated to ethical considerations in the use of AI, including the importance of anonymizing data before uploading it to LLMs and understanding the biases AI models might reflect [6].\n\n7. **Types of AI Models**: It categorizes different types of AI models, such as those used for text, image, video, and audio processing, along with popular model families and common use cases [10].\n\n8. **Interactive Elements and Exercises**: The presentation includes interactive elements, such as role-play exercises and discussions on ethical scenarios involving AI [9].\n\nSlides also emphasize building a common language for cross-team discussions about AI at DeanHouston and developing confidence in using AI strategically [1].\n\nThe presentation aims to educate attendees on AI\u2019s capabilities, underlying technologies, and ethical considerations, while encouraging them to experiment with AI responsibly [1], [10].", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T17:40:49.117995+00:00", "referenced_images": [], "context_details": [{"index": 1, "snippet": "## PRESENTATION SUMMARY ##\nTotal Slides: 75\n\n## SLIDE 1 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nAI\nAI: \nFoundational Training\n\n\n## SLIDE 2 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nMatt\nCo-Founder | Orchard\nCo-Founder | Viridity Technologies\nXU Professor |...", "full_text": "## PRESENTATION SUMMARY ##\nTotal Slides: 75\n\n## SLIDE 1 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nAI\nAI: \nFoundational Training\n\n\n## SLIDE 2 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nMatt\nCo-Founder | Orchard\nCo-Founder | Viridity Technologies\nXU Professor | AI & Emerging Tech\nAedhan\nLead AI Engineer | Viridity Technologies\n\nIMAGES:\nImage 1:\n  Description: a man with glasses and a blue shirt\nImage 2:\n  Description: a man in a black shirt and a watch\n\n\n## SLIDE 3 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nMatt | 3 Truths and 1 Lie\nI majored in marketing\nI have citizenship in Ireland\nI hate scary movies\nI have no pets\n\n\n## SLIDE 4 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nAedhan | 3 Truths and 1 Lie\nAedhan is my middle name, not my first name\nI lived in Austria for a year\nI have Canadian Citizenship\nI've hiked up a volcano\n\n\n## SLIDE 5 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nHow frequently do you use Large Language Models (GPT, Gemini, Claude) at DeanHouston\nThe Slido app must be installed on every computer you\u2019re presenting from\nDo not edit\nHow to change the design\n\nIMAGES:\nImage 1:\n  Description: a blue icon with a white arrow pointing up\nImage 2:\n  Description: the logo for the new line of products\nImage 3:\n  Description: the logo for the studio\n\n\n## SLIDE 6 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nRole Play Exercise\n\n\n## SLIDE 7 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nI am a DeanHouston client. \nI asked you about your POV on AI. \n\nQ: What do you say?\n\n\n## SLIDE 8 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nThoughts on a Simple, Approachable POV\nAI isn\u2019t new to us, but it\u2019s evolving rapidly. \n\nIt\u2019s just like any other Business Technology.
