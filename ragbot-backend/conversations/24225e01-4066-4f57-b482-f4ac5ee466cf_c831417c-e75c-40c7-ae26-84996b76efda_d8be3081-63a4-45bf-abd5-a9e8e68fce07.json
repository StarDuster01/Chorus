This can be developed in-house or built upon existing open-source frameworks with appropriate legal and licensing considerations. [1]\n\n- **Design Inputs**: The system should have an interface for engineers to enter performance requirements including topology, inductance, power, etc. [1]\n\n## Operational Requirements:\n- **Usability**: The system should be intuitive and easy to use, even for employees with minimal technical background. [3]\n\n- **Security**: The system must adhere to appropriate security standards to protect sensitive design data and customer information. [3]\n\n- **Compliance**: Control, storage, and access to data must fully comply with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Each associate must have a unique login to prevent non-eligible individuals from accessing restricted data. [3]\n\n- **Competitive Advantage**: The system must be developed to maintain competitive advantage against broadly used industry software in providing innovative design solutions. [3]\n\nThe document appears to be a Request For Proposal (RFP) [2] with evaluation criteria for vendor proposals based on technical merit, project approach, experience, price, and other relevant factors.
