Here's a summary of the key sections:\n\n## Text-Based LLMs and Chatbots\n- Covers \"The Big Three\" frontier models: Claude (by Anthropic), ChatGPT (by OpenAI), and Gemini\n- Demonstrates ChatGPT's capabilities, including creating spreadsheets and visualizing data\n- Highlights Claude's features, including enhanced data privacy, security, and advanced visualization options (such as interactive relationship graphs)\n\n## AI Image Generation\n- Shows examples from various AI image generation models:\n  - OpenAI's Sora: Demonstrates both simple/short prompts and long, detailed prompts\n  - Black Forest Lab's Flux 1.1: Compares results from short prompts (\"A person\") and detailed prompts\n- Includes \"This Person Does Not Exist\" - a random face generator\n- Examines the challenge of distinguishing real from AI-generated faces\n\n## AI Video Generation\n- Discusses the evolution of AI video generation capabilities\n\n## AI Audio Generation\n- Text-to-Speech technologies like ElevenLabs\n- AI voice mimicking for phone calls\n- Retelli's automated secretaries, receptionists, tech support\n- AI music generation with Suno for creating original music and jingles\n\n## Ethical Scenarios\nThe presentation dedicates significant attention to ethical considerations across multiple levels:\n\n### Employee Level Scenarios:\n1. Company Secrets: An employee using public ChatGPT to draft a press release with confidential information\n2. Unvetted Code: A developer using GitHub Copilot to auto-generate code without proper security checks\n\n### Company Level Scenarios:\n1. Algorithmic Bias: An LLM used in HR showing bias toward certain educational and racial backgrounds\n2. AI Surveillance: An AI camera system meant for safety tracking being used to monitor employee \"idle time\"\n\n### Image Generation Bias:\n- Interactive exercise asking participants to imagine a CEO\n- Demonstration that AI image generators consistently produce images of white men in suits when asked to generate \"A CEO\"\n- Shows that AI can generate images of women CEOs when explicitly prompted, but defaults to male CEOs otherwise\n- Highlights the disparity between AI representation (100% male) and reality (10-15% female CEOs)\n\nThe presentation appears designed to provide a balanced view of AI capabilities while raising important ethical considerations about its use in business contexts.", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T20:15:37.752889+00:00"}, {"id": "de162a58-0a56-49fb-a5ea-81dd7e6a8c60", "role": "user", "content": "Show me the dean houston logo ", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T20:15:51.292689+00:00"}, {"id": "3f9d2b2c-6009-4ac2-a67f-f4c507a62fc3", "role": "assistant", "content": "The provided context does not include a specific mention or image of the Dean Houston logo.
