Here is a summary of the content based on the slides:\n\n1. **Introduction** - Begins with personal anecdotes and an introduction to the presenter, including a few truths and a lie about the presenter's background [4].\n2. **Types of Models and Capabilities** - The presentation discusses various AI models and their capabilities, highlighting tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and others, emphasizing their enhanced data privacy, security, and advanced visualization options [1], [5].\n3. **AI Image Generation** - Slides explore the capabilities of AI in generating images using different models such as OpenAI's Sora. There are examples of short and long prompts to demonstrate the flexibility and creativity of these image generation models [2], [6].\n4. **AI Video and Audio Generation** - Discusses the journey of AI in video generation and advancements in text-to-speech technologies. Services like ElevenLabs and Retelli are mentioned, which involve mimicking voices and creating music [1].\n5. **Ethical Scenarios** - Several ethical scenarios at both employee and company levels are presented to illustrate potential issues and conflicts that can arise when using AI technologies. These include issues of data privacy, unvetted code, algorithmic bias detection, and surveillance overreach [1], [3].\n6. **Bias in AI** - The final slides address biases in AI-generated images, particularly in how AI reflects societal norms and sometimes the biases of its creators. The scenarios demonstrate the discrepancy between AI-generated CEOs and actual diversity statistics in leadership [3].\n\nThe presentation extensively covers the technical capabilities of AI and also emphasizes ethical considerations and societal impacts, showcasing a balanced view of AI technologies.", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T19:09:58.090261+00:00", "referenced_images": [], "context_details": [{"index": 1, "snippet": "## PRESENTATION SUMMARY ##\nTotal Slides: 25\n\n## SLIDE 14 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nThe Journey of AI Video Generation\n\n\n## SLIDE 15 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nThe Journey of AI Video Generation\n\n\n\n\nCONTENT:\nThe Journey of AI Vi...", "full_text": "## PRESENTATION SUMMARY ##\nTotal Slides: 25\n\n## SLIDE 14 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nThe Journey of AI Video Generation\n\n\n## SLIDE 15 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nThe Journey of AI Video Generation\n\n\n\n\nCONTENT:\nThe Journey of AI Video Generation\n\n\n## SLIDE 16 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nText, Video, Image...... and Audio!\nText to Speech\nElevenLabs\nNew AI Voices\nAI Mimicking specific voices\nPhone Calls\nRetelli\nAutomated Secretaries, Receptionists, Tech Support, Q&A\nMusic\nSuno\nCompletely new music\nCreate Jingles\n\n\n## SLIDE 17 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nEthical Scenarios: Employee Level\nScenario 1: Company Secrets\nLate at night, a junior marketing associate pasted the secret specs for next quarter's flagship product into public ChatGPT to create a press release much faster then they could write one themselves.

Two months later, a routine audit revealed snippets lifted from GPL code and a latent vulnerability that exposed customer credit cards. One saved deadline has become a costly remediation nightmare.\nsora\n\nIMAGES:\nImage 1:\n  Description: a man sitting at a desk with a laptop and a clock\n  Text content: Payment\nModule\n\n\n## SLIDE 19 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nEthical Scenarios: Company Level\nScenario 1: Algorithmic Bias Detection\nYour company's HR department has implemented an LLM that assists with reviewing job applications. After several months, an employee notices that the system seems to prioritize candidates from certain educational and racial backgrounds and consistently ranks others lower, despite similar or even identical qualifications. If this gets out\u00a0lawsuits will ensue for discrimination against protected class.\nsora\n\nIMAGES:\nImage 1:\n  Description: a man holding a magnit\n\n\n## SLIDE 20 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nEthical Scenarios: Company Level\nScenario 2: AI Workplace Surveillance Goes Too Far\nEager to boost efficiency, the executive team rolled out an AI powered camera system that supposedly just tracked safety incidents on the factory floor. Within weeks, the software began ranking individual \"idle time\" and piping the scores straight into the performance dashboards\u2014leading managers to discipline staff for longer water-cooler chats. This triggered a huge drop in job satisfaction and a slew of workforce-wide privacy complaints that was quickly picked up by the press, becoming a national discussion-point.\n\nIMAGES:\nImage 1:\n  Description: a group of people standing in front of a large screen\n  Text content: IDLE TIME SCORES\n\n\n## SLIDE 21 ##", "document_id": "089cfddc-55d5-4000-8223-1dc727c4e4b3", "filename": "AI_Training_for_Agencies_DeanHouston_4.25.25_1.pptx", "dataset_id": "7a4336de-dffb-44c0-aa05-3ba6dce6f674"}], "image_details": []}, {"id": "26c056a5-10a5-4c98-bbdf-b95d705854e3", "role": "user", "content": "Show me the dean houston image logo ", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T19:10:07.563290+00:00"}, {"id": "326483ed-f02f-418e-83d5-da94596a9a4d", "role": "assistant", "content": "The logo for Dean Houston is shown in [Image 1], which has the caption \"the logo for dean houston.\" This image is available for viewing and download.", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T19:10:13.346831+00:00", "referenced_images": ["/api/images/02c0117f-b40d-4ba5-9191-f61977e91fc6_R.png"], "context_details": [], "image_details": [{"index": "Image 1", "caption": "the logo for dean houston", "url": "/api/images/02c0117f-b40d-4ba5-9191-f61977e91fc6_R.png", "download_url": "/api/images/02c0117f-b40d-4ba5-9191-f61977e91fc6_R.png?download=true", "id": "87182654-108b-4a66-92ae-ba1fb495a64d", "dataset_id": "7a4336de-dffb-44c0-aa05-3ba6dce6f674"}]}]}
