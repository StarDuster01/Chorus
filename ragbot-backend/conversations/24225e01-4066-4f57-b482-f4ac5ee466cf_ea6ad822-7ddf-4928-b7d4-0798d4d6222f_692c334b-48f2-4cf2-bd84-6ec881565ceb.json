There are also sections on ethical scenarios at employee and company levels, discussing potential issues like sharing company secrets or unvetted code in AI systems [2], [3].\n\n- **Slides 21-24**: These slides delve into ethical scenarios related to AI image generation and bias. They discuss how AI image generators may reflect societal biases, for instance, consistently generating images of CEOs as men unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
