Two months later, a routine audit revealed snippets lifted from GPL code and a latent vulnerability that exposed customer credit cards. One saved deadline has become a costly remediation nightmare.\nsora\n\nIMAGES:\nImage 1:\n  Description: a man sitting at a desk with a laptop and a clock\n  Text content: Payment\nModule\n\n\n## SLIDE 19 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nEthical Scenarios: Company Level\nScenario 1: Algorithmic Bias Detection\nYour company's HR department has implemented an LLM that assists with reviewing job applications.

Within weeks, the software began ranking individual \"idle time\" and piping the scores straight into the performance dashboards\u2014leading managers to discipline staff for longer water-cooler chats. This triggered a huge drop in job satisfaction and a slew of workforce-wide privacy complaints that was quickly picked up by the press, becoming a national discussion-point.\n\nIMAGES:\nImage 1:\n  Description: a group of people standing in front of a large screen\n  Text content: IDLE TIME SCORES\n\n\n## SLIDE 21 ##", "document_id": "089cfddc-55d5-4000-8223-1dc727c4e4b3", "filename": "AI_Training_for_Agencies_DeanHouston_4.25.25_1.pptx", "dataset_id": "7a4336de-dffb-44c0-aa05-3ba6dce6f674"}], "image_details": []}, {"id": "226bee62-c405-454e-b764-eb2676f6901a", "role": "user", "content": "Show me the Dean Houston Logo ", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T20:05:32.694150+00:00"}, {"id": "6f4cf204-004e-4671-8f03-123e0067817a", "role": "assistant", "content": "The Dean Houston logo can be seen in the image labeled [Image 1], which is captioned as \"the logo for dean houston.\" This image is available for viewing and download.", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T20:05:34.384629+00:00", "referenced_images": ["/api/images/02c0117f-b40d-4ba5-9191-f61977e91fc6_R.png"], "context_details": [], "image_details": [{"index": "Image 1", "caption": "the logo for dean houston", "url": "/api/images/02c0117f-b40d-4ba5-9191-f61977e91fc6_R.png", "download_url": "/api/images/02c0117f-b40d-4ba5-9191-f61977e91fc6_R.png?download=true", "id": "87182654-108b-4a66-92ae-ba1fb495a64d", "dataset_id": "7a4336de-dffb-44c0-aa05-3ba6dce6f674"}]}, {"id": "b175bd71-2b50-4d79-9e2a-bd1a11cacb9f", "role": "user", "content": "Shoiw me a Rhino ", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T20:05:40.142261+00:00"}, {"id": "f3b13ea6-99a2-4b25-afec-a6c24fc98850", "role": "assistant", "content": "A relevant image of a rhino is available in [Image 1], captioned as \"a white rhino and her calf in the wild.\" This image can be viewed and downloaded.", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T20:05:42.822062+00:00", "referenced_images": ["/api/images/9fe556ba-5acb-4754-90c1-35e24e741650_wp2462298.jpg"], "context_details": [], "image_details": [{"index": "Image 1", "caption": "a white rhino and her calf in the wild", "url": "/api/images/9fe556ba-5acb-4754-90c1-35e24e741650_wp2462298.jpg", "download_url": "/api/images/9fe556ba-5acb-4754-90c1-35e24e741650_wp2462298.jpg?download=true", "id": "c4ea9a88-da54-4573-a600-a395f80acee4", "dataset_id": "7a4336de-dffb-44c0-aa05-3ba6dce6f674"}]}]}
