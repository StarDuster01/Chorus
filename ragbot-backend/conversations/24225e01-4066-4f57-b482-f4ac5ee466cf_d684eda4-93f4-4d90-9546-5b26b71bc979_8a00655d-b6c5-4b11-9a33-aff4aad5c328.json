These models can inherit and amplify biases present in their training data, which might result in outputs that reinforce stereotypes or discriminate against certain groups. Additionally, the inner workings of LLMs are often opaque, making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes or to trace the origins of their outputs. They might also inadvertently memorize and regurgitate sensitive or personal information, raising privacy concerns. Furthermore, they can generate content that infringes on existing copyrights or intellectual property, leading to legal and ethical challenges [1].", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T14:32:02.335886"}]}
