Topics include issues like company secrets being leaked, unvetted code usage, algorithmic bias detection, and AI workplace surveillance. There is also a focus on image generation biases related to representation in AI-generated images [2], [3].\n\n5. **Text-Based LLMs and AI Tools**: Early slides such as slide 4 mention text-based large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini and cover types of models and capabilities [4].\n\nPlease note that the provided context includes references across multiple slides, but some details may be incomplete (such as content in the journey of AI video generation) and thus not fully described here [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6].", "timestamp": "2025-05-14T18:47:51.438378+00:00", "referenced_images": [], "context_details": [{"index": 1, "snippet": "## PRESENTATION SUMMARY ##\nTotal Slides: 25\n\n## SLIDE 7 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nAI Image Generation\n\nIMAGES:\nImage 1:\n  Description: digital art by alex kro\nImage 2:\n  Description: chat chat - chat chat - chat c...", "full_text": "## PRESENTATION SUMMARY ##\nTotal Slides: 25\n\n## SLIDE 7 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nAI Image Generation\n\nIMAGES:\nImage 1:\n  Description: digital art by alex kro\nImage 2:\n  Description: chat chat - chat chat - chat chat chat chat chat chat chat chat chat chat chat chat chat chat chat\n  Text content: ChatGPT\nImage 3:\n  Description: a blue shield with a black background\nImage 4:\n  Description: a blue and black background\nImage 5:\n  Description: a blue circle with a plane in it\nImage 6:\n  Description: a man in a white shirt and tie\n\n\n## SLIDE 8 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nAI Image Models and Services\nOpenAI's Sora\nSimple/Short Prompts\nBob Ross painting a self portrait, which is painting a self portrait\nMr Rogers from Mr Rogers Neighborhood having a sitdown talk with Mike Tyson who has his feet up relaxing on an ottoman\n\nIMAGES:\nImage 1:\n  Description: a painting of two men with a painting ease\nImage 2:\n  Description: a man sitting on a chair\n\n\n\n\nCONTENT:\nAI Image Models and Services\nOpenAI's Sora\nSimple/Short Prompts\nBob Ross painting a self portrait, which is painting a self portrait\nMr Rogers from Mr Rogers Neighborhood having a sitdown talk with Mike Tyson who has his feet up relaxing on an ottoman\n\nIMAGES:\nImage 1:\n  Description: a painting of two men with a painting ease\nImage 2:\n  Description: a man sitting on a chair\n\n\n## SLIDE 9 ##\n\nCONTENT:\nAI Image Models and Services\nDemo Time!\nhttps://sora.chatgpt.com/\nOpenAI's Sora\nLong, detailed prompts\nSteve irwin in a tan colored space suit with no helmet grappling with a large crocodile on the ISS in zero g.
